### Documentation for R script ###

# This script runs after "PIF_analysis_part_1.r". After we've generated a distribution of 
# PIFs/attributable mortality/incidence for each subgroup/dietary factor/disease, 
# we run this to generate summary statistics (median, uncertainty intervals) of 
# the output generated in part one.

# file (alldisease), observed mortality/incidence sims file (total disease), and 
# observed population sims file (pop.draws).

# Recall that, for the purposes of calculating the PIFs, we treat each 
# outcome/pathway as a distinct outcome (direct effect, mediated by BMI, and

# different variables. Below is code do that.

# That is, summary statistics for broader subgroups (results by age, results by 
# sex, results by disease type, etc... as opposed results by each age/sex/race/outcome/etc..).

# We will create results for all possible combinations that could be of interest 
# here but you will choose what to report based on what your research focus is.

# First we put all strata of interest into a vector called "strata". Then we 
# loop through the length of that vector. For each iteration i of that loop, we 
# extract all combinations of that vector with i element using the combn function, 
# convert the resulting matrix to a list, and append those list elements to 
# "strata.combos" list which will have an element for each possible strata combination.

# Not all combinations are of interest. We want to, at the very least, have 
# outcome pathway or a disease type as a strata (Results are event-specific 
# after all. We aren't reporting all preventable events by age when the types 
# of events are not even consistent by outcome). Also, not all the strata are 
# mutually exclusive. It's redundant to stratify by disease type 1 if you're 
# already stratifying by outcome so we don't need any strata combos that has 
# both outcome and disease type 1, for example. We want to filter out unnecessary 
# strata combos, which is what the code below does (we loop through the list of 
# strata combos and identify the index the strata combos that qualify as of interest).
                                                                                                                         
# An astute reader might note that stratifying just by "pathway" and not
